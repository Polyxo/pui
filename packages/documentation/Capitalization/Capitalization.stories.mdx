Typography plays a critical role in any design; in fact, it accounts for as
much as 95% of everything we see on the Web. When done well, it adds
personality to content, becomes its voice. When established poorly,
typographic elements become unreadable, thus reducing the impact a given piece
of content will have on the reader.

In some cases, it will lead to problems with processing text, and thus
increasing cognitive load on the user. The bigger the congnitive load is, the
harder it is for users to complete their tasks.

### Capitalization and user interface: when to use or not.

This is an adaptation to user interfaces of the [Capitalization section of the
WFP Editorial Style
Guide](https://cdn.wfp.org/guides/editorial/content/capitalization/) and [capitalization guidelines for WFPgo](https://communities.wfp.org/post/capitalization-titles) (intranet link).
[GOV.UK provides useful guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) on how to write for the user in plain English.

- Capitalization is appropriate in titles of documents, publications, and for proper nouns.

- The labels and terms we use on user interfaces are neither proper nouns nor titles most of the time.

- Capitalization makes the text harder to scan and read, while sentence case is easier on the eye.

People tend to over-capitalize when writing in sentences, whereas **navigation
labels** , **column** and **row headers**, **input fields** in forms,

**action verbs** on **buttons** are sentences made of common nouns that should
be easy to recognize and act upon.

They work as **instructions** and **pointers** and as such must not be
capitalized. This can be Distracting and Make Reading harder (compare with,
this can be distracting and make reading harder).

On user interfaces, we prefer **sentence case**, i.e. we capitalize the
first word of the label, then use lower case except for proper nouns (e.g _View document_ vs _View Country Strategic Plan_) and words derived
from proper nouns (e.g. _Italian_ as the adjective derived from _Italy_).

**Do not capitalize** these UI elements:

- **Input field labels in forms** and **column headers**:

- the density of text labels and column headers would make the interface
  less usable if they were to be treated as proper nouns or titles.

- The same labels are used often as field labels and column headers and capitalizing them in tables and not in the forms would make the interface
  very inconsistent.

- **Navigation labels**: e.g. Commodity prices, Shipping rates, Imp/Exp
  restrictions.

- **Controlled lists in drop-down menus**: avoid as much as possible when
  creating a controlled vocabulary that will be displayed in a drop-down
  menu. If the list is originated from an external data source, try removing
  capitalization with frontend tools

- **Section headings** : e.g. Main documents; Technical reviews.

- **Titles of charts in dashboards** : apply the same rules for titles and
  headings: use sentence case and capitalize only proper nouns. e.g. implementation plan; resource-based plan; management plan. Chart
  titles refer to the content of the plans and CO submissions, not to
  document titles,

### Word checklist

Refer to [Word Index in the Editorial Style Guide](https://cdn.wfp.org/guides/editorial/reference/wordindex/). Then look here:

- Use sentence case (no capitals)

- These are common names, unless used in a title of a publication or a programme , I.e. part of proper noun or title.

- management plan

- implementation plan
- needs-based plan
- resource-based plan
- assignment plan

- line of sight
- smallholder farmers
- cash-based transfer
- country director (Country Director of X)
- country office (not “CO”)
- country operation management plan
- country portfolio budget
- country strategic plans
- country strategic review
- Use title case (capitalize)
- Strategic Goal
- Strategic Objective
- Strategic Result
- Strategic Outcome
- Management Plan (when referred to the title of the EB document, not the abstract content of the management plan)
