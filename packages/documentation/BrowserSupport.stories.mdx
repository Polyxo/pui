> ##### IE11 support
>
> Please notice that the UI Kit currently supports IE11, but it will no longer do it in future releases.
> Those applications that do not work properly or do not work at all in IE11 will need to include a warning message inviting the user to switch to a more modern browser.
> The warning can be found [here]('Design|Templates', 'Browser Warning').

Currently the following browsers are supported:

- **Microsoft Edge** latest & last four versions
- **Mozilla Firefox** latest & last four versions
- **Google Chrome** latest & last four versions
- **Safari** latest & last two versions

**Microsoft Internet Explorer** is no longer be supported.

Please make sure that your application is independent of which browser is used to access them (i.e. browser agnostic).
