### React Applications

If you want to use the ESLint configuration in a project you can install it with the [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app). It also includes the eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y accessibility rules by default. When using Create React App no action is needed since it already includes the configuration.

#### .eslintrc

```javascript
{
  "extends": "react-app"
}
```
