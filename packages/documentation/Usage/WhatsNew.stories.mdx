### Updated/Fixed components

- [BannerNavigation](https://uikit.wfp.org/docs/index.html?path=/docs/components-navigations-bannernavigation--regular-navigation) - fixed a bug where the component was hidden on tablets
- [FileUploader](https://uikit.wfp.org/docs/index.html?path=/docs/components-forms-fileuploader-react-dropzone--regular) - now using react-dropzone , to ensure the different use cases are covered

- [Card](https://uikit.wfp.org/docs/index.html?path=/docs/components-content-related-card--text-card) - it was holding variations that were more like heroes elements, so the two have been split and the Hero now is a component on its own
