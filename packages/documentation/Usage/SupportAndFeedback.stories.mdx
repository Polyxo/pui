### GitHub

Bugs and features requests can be created on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/wfp/ui). Pull requests are always welcome.

If you plan to implement a new idea make sure it fits into the [official software solutions technology stack](https://newgo.wfp.org/documents/software-solutions-technology-stack).
Also if you are not sure if a component already exists or you would like to request the implementation please contact the #ux-ui Slack channel.

### UX-design review

It is recommended to discuss UX/UI drafts with us. You can either post them public in the #ux-ui channel or by directly contacting us on Slack.

### Onboarding sessions

If you are new to WFP or using the UI-Kit please book a onboarding session with us. It will take 30-45 minutes and we will provide you with the design and/or implementation basics.
