### UI Kit library for Figma

The Kit is available as a Figma library, for rapid prototyping of web based applications.
It contains all the resources you need to get started, and consists of three interconnected libraries (Foundations, Components and Templates) for a better scalability.

**Components** and **Templates** consume the design specs included in **Foundations** (e.g. colours, typography styles, etc.), and this does not include any component of its own.
Thus, components and templates will be the elements that you will find under the Assets panel within Figma. Icons and logos are also available as components.

Every **component** in the Kit has been built using the **Variants** feature, meaning that you can quickly switch among different states or types. Most components support the **Auto Layout** feature,
so they grow or shrink as you edit their content.

All **templates** come with four different resolutions, based on the breakpoints in the code: 500px, 792px, 992px and 1200px. Grids are available at all resolutions, and for the larger one,
you can choose between two grids: 12 cols/32px gutter or 12 cols/20px gutter.

The library is currently available **under invitation only**, please send your request to global.uikit@wfp.org

Once invited, create your drafts under the **World Food Programme** space to access the library components.
