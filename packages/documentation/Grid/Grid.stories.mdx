<hr/>

The UI Kit doesn't come with a CSS grid system. We recommend the use of
a modern flexbox based grid system like [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/), which is also
available as react components.

- [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/) A grid system based on the flex display property.
- [React-FlexBox-Grid](https://roylee0704.github.io/react-flexbox-grid/) The React module of Flexbox Grid
