## Usage

Footer is the second most important place where your basic site information and links should live. Users turn often to the footer to look for important information, such as contact details, or links to less prominent sections of the website (privacy policy, terms of use, etc).
It can contain `<Form>` , `<Button>`, `<Link>` and `images`.

#### When to use

Use when you want to share information like contacts details, privacy policy, terms of use, copyright.

#### When not to use

The `Footer` component is not sectioning content and therefore shouldn't be used introduce a new section in the outline.
