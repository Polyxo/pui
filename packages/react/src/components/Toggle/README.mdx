**Toggles** are controls that are used to quickly switch between two possible states. The example below shows
an uncontrolled Toggle component. To use the Toggle component as a controlled component, set the toggled property.
Setting the toggled property will allow you to change the value dynamically, whereas setting the defaultToggled
prop will only set the value initially.
