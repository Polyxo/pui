This is the documentation website for the WFP Design System.

The website runs on a Vercel instance and can be deployed using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) or [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

## Run on Amplify

Make sure your branch has the correct framework settings

```
aws amplify update-branch --app-id <value> --branch-name <value> --framework 'Next.js - SSR --profile <value>'
```
