## Bridge Library for Figma

Bridge is available as a Figma library, for rapid prototyping of web based applications. It contains all the resources you need to get started, At the moment it consist of a single library that contains **Foundations** (Colours, Typography, Icons, Grids), **Design Components** and **Data Visualisation**.

Gradually this library will be split in independent libraries.

**Components** and **Data Visualization** consume the design specs included in **Foundations** (e.g. colours, typography styles, etc.), and this does not include any component of its own. Thus, components and templates will be the elements that you will find under the Assets panel within Figma. Icons and logos are also available as components.

Every **component** in Bridge has been built using the **Variants** feature, meaning that you can quickly switch among different states or types. Most components support the **Auto Layout** feature, so they grow or shrink as you edit their content.

The components have their own <u>Design Tokens</u> already embedded.

The colour palette reflects Material design guidelines and it’s already structured for accessibility.

The library is currently available **under invitation only**, please send your request to [global.uikit@wfp.org](mailto:global.uikit@wfp.org)

Once invited, create your drafts under the **World Food Programme** space to access the library components.

## Legacy UI-Kit

The legacy UI-Kit is still available in the three libraries: Foundations, Components and Templates. Design components of the legacy UI-Kit are not maintained any more.
