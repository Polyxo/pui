It’s possible to use all FontAwesome icons as well all free [humanitarian icons by OCHA](https://fontawesome.com/icons/categories/humanitarian).

It’s possible to swap icons simply changing the name of the variation in the property panel. The name has to be the one AWESOME font adopt.

<DoUse>

- Use icons to enhance user experience by providing visual cues or representing actions, concepts, or content.
- Use icons consistently throughout the interface to maintain coherence and aid in recognition.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Avoid using icons without clear meaning or association with the intended action or content.
- Avoid overusing icons, especially when text would be more appropriate for clarity or accessibility.

</DoNotUse>

### Alternative components

If an icon doesn't adequately convey meaning or if text is preferred for clarity, consider using text labels or tooltips instead.

### Accessibility

- Ensure that icons are accompanied by descriptive text or tooltips to provide context for users who may rely on screen readers.
- Use accessible colors and contrast ratios for icons to ensure visibility and legibility for all users.
- Test icons with screen readers and other assistive technologies to verify their accessibility.
