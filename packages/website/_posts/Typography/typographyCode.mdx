Depending on your frontend stack you can use different methods to load the fonts. The following examples are for React and Next.js. If you are using a different stack, please refer to the [Google Fonts documentation](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started).

### Next.js

`next/font` will automatically optimize your fonts (including custom fonts) and remove external network requests for improved privacy and performance.

Make sure to set the `--font-family-primary` css variable as seen below.

```jsx
import { Open_Sans } from "next/font/google";

// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight
const openSans = Open_Sans({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-family-primary", // CSS variable name used by the Design System
});

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <main className={openSans.className}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </main>
  );
}
```
