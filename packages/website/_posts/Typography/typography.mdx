WFP's visual identity uses a single font family. Like the logo, WFP blue and the colour pallete, this font is characterizing element of WFP's brand.

## Typefaces

Open Sans is the typeface for user interfaces; itâ€™s a round, humanist sans-serif, with incredibly warm appeal. It can be used for both headlines and paragraphs alike, as well as for interface elements.

## How to use it

Open Sans is already included in the WFP UI's CSS. If you don't want to include the font you can use set \$css--font-face: false; inside scss.

## Other languages & styles

The official languages of WFP are English, French, Spanish and Arabic. Please use the OpenSans typeface for English, Spanish, and French and the Arial typeface for Arabic.

## Default formating
