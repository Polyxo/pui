The eMail template can be used for application related notifications. It is responsive and works in Microsoft Outlook, [Microsoft Outlook on the web](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?realm=wfp.org&exsvurl=1&ll-cc=1031&modurl=0) and most other eMail clients.

Make sure to also provide a text-only version of your eMail and consider using a css inliner tool like [ Mailchimp CSS Inliner Tool](https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css).
