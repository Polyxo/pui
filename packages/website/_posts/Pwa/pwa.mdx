They are installable and live on the user's home screen, without the need for an app store.
They offer an experience that is as close as possible to a native app and fully support offline usage.
They are built and delivered using web technologies like `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. This way you can use the react.js UI-Kit to build your PWA.

### Capacitor

Using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/), you can build Progressive Web Apps that run natively on iOS, Android, and the web. It allows to use the same codebase for web and native apps, and it's a great way to build cheaper cross-platform apps.

### Safe-areas

The `safe-area-inset-\*` CSS properties are used to define the padding required to keep content from being obscured by display cutouts or rounded corners on a mobile device. This is a great way to make sure your app is not cut off by the notch on the iPhone or Android devices with a notch.

### Components

All components support mobile devices. For the main UI there are `<BottomNavigation />`, `<SidebarNavigation />` available. They are responsive and can be used on mobile and desktop devices.
