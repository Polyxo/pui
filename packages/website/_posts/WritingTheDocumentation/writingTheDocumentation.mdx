## Editing pages

The easiest way to edit a page is with the `Edit this page on Github` link that appears at the bottom of every page on the site. The link opens the specific Github page where you can edit the content and then propose the change with a pull request.

Alternatively, if you have a specific fix or contribution, you can fork the repo and generate a pull request.

## Content and style guidelines

Before you get started, take a moment to review our content guidelines. Following these will help us ensure consistency of experience across the site.

### Use Markdown

The website is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which makes it easy for anyone to contribute content in a systematic way. If you don’t already have a Markdown editor installed, there are plenty of free editors available online.

## Guidelines for writing content

Please keep these things in mind when writing content for Carbon.

Aim for a friendly and encouraging tone.
Speak directly to the user. You can use the second person pronoun (“you”).
Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.
Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words. The more concise the text, the easier it is for all users to understand.
Use sentence case for everything, including component names, e.g. Content switcher and Data table.

### Components

Each file begins with a [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) section that contains metadata about the page. The frontmatter section is surrounded by three dashes on either side. The frontmatter section is written in YAML.

#### Callout

```jsx
<Callout title="Note" kind="info">
  If you are a designer working at WFP, please refer to our team to join the WFP
  Figma organization.
</Callout>
```

#### Embeed Figma

Embeed Figma files directly as interactive prototypes. You can also embed specific frames from a Figma file.

<CodeBlock language="jsx" source={`<Figma
  url="https://www.figma.com/file/wFEEbUEWrlfMhs2a1S2RTp/UN-core-website?node-id=0%3A1&t=ffaLsECV8p10ZEa4-1"
  height="300"
/>`}>

<Figma
  url="https://www.figma.com/file/wFEEbUEWrlfMhs2a1S2RTp/UN-core-website?node-id=0%3A1&t=ffaLsECV8p10ZEa4-1"
  height="300"
/>

</CodeBlock>

Embeed a specific frame from a Figma file as image (loads faster).

<CodeBlock language="jsx" source={`<FigmaImage document="wFEEbUEWrlfMhs2a1S2RTp" node="801:341" />`}>

<FigmaImage document="wFEEbUEWrlfMhs2a1S2RTp" node="801:341" />

</CodeBlock>

#### Storybook

Embeed a Storybook component directly from the Storybook website. Define the `path` of the component.

```md live
<Storybook
  path="iframe.html?viewMode=docs&id=components-ui-elements-button--documentation" 
/>
```

#### Do and Don't

Use the `DoUse` and `DoNotUse` components to show examples of good and bad practices.

<CodeBlock language="jsx" source={`<DoUse>

- Use accordions to organize information
- Use accordions to reduce the amount of scrolling required
- Use accordions to reduce the amount of information displayed on the screen at once

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Do not use accordions to display information that is not related
- Do not use accordions to display information that is not hierarchical
- Do not use accordions to display information that is not collapsible

</DoNotUse>`}>
