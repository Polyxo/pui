## Component common props

When developing a component, you should always document the props. This is done by using TypeScript's `interface` syntax.

```tsx
interface CommonProps {
  /**
   * The ID of the component
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * The class name of the component
   */
  className: string;
  /**
   * The style of the component
   */
  style: React.CSSProperties;
}
```

The following props are common to a lot of components and should be reused as much as possible.

### `kind`

The kind of the component is used to define a behavior of the component

TODO: Currenty called type in Figma, but should be renamed to kind

```tsx
/**
 * The kind of the component is used to define a behavior or a style of the component
 */
kind: "primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary";
```

#### `type`

The type of the component is used to define a style of the component. It is used to define for example the color of the component.

```tsx
/**
 * The type of the component is used to define a style of the component. It is used to define for example the color of the component.
 */
type: "default" | "success" | "warning" | "error";
```

The difference between `kind` and `type` is that `kind` is used to define a behavior of the component, while `type` is used to define a style of the component.

### `size`

The size of the component is used to define the size of the component.

```tsx
/**
 * The size of the component is used to define the size of the component
 */
size: "small" | "medium" | "large";
```

### `disabled`

The disabled prop is used to define if the component is disabled or not.

```tsx
/**
 * The disabled prop is used to define if the component is disabled or not
 */
disabled: boolean;
```

### `loading`

The loading prop is used to define if the component is in a loading state or not.

```tsx
/**
 * The loading prop is used to define if the component is in a loading state or not
 */
loading: boolean;
```

### `onClick`

The onClick prop is used to define the click event of the component.

```tsx
/**
 * The onClick prop is used to define the click event of the component
 */
onClick: (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void;
```

### `onChange`

The onChange prop is used to define the change event of the component.

```tsx

/**
 * The onChange prop is used to define the change event of the component
 */
onChange: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
```

Other `onAction` events should be documented in the same way.

### `pageWidth`

The pageWidth prop is used to define the width of the page and is usually using the `Wrapper` component internally.

```tsx
/**
 * The pageWidth prop is used to define the width of the page
 */
pageWidth: "small" | "medium" | "large";
```
