### Azure DevOps üöÄ

The UI-Kit is developed on [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/worldfoodprogramme/Design%20System). You can find the source code, documentation and the issue tracker there.

### GitHub üë©‚Äçüíª

Bugs and features requests can be created on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/wfp/ui). Pull requests are always welcome.

If you plan to implement a new idea make sure it fits into the [official software solutions technology stack](https://newgo.wfp.org/documents/software-solutions-technology-stack).
Also if you are not sure if a component already exists or you would like to request the implementation please contact the [#ux-ui Slack channel](https://wfp.slack.com/archives/C53A4FMFG).

### UX-design review

It is recommended to discuss UX/UI drafts with us. You can either post them public in the [#ux-ui channel](https://wfp.slack.com/archives/C53A4FMFG) or by directly contacting us on Slack.

### Onboarding sessions

If you are new to WFP or using the UI-Kit please book a onboarding session with us. It will take 30-45 minutes and we will provide you with the design and/or implementation basics.
