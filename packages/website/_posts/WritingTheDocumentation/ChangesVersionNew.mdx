### Full TypeScript rewrite

We would love to hear your feedback and ideas about the UI-Kit.
You can contact us via our [Slack channel #ux-ui](https://wfp.slack.com/archives/C53A4FMFG) or via an email to [global.uikit@wfp.org](mailto:global.uikit@wfp.org).

### Mono-Repo

Bugs and features requests can be created on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/wfp/ui). Pull requests are always welcome.

If you plan to implement a new idea make sure it fits into the [official software solutions technology stack](https://newgo.wfp.org/documents/software-solutions-technology-stack).
Also if you are not sure if a component already exists or you would like to request the implementation please contact the [#ux-ui Slack channel](https://wfp.slack.com/archives/C53A4FMFG).

### Theming

It is recommended to discuss UX/UI drafts with us. You can either post them public in the #ux-ui channel or by directly contacting us on Slack.

### Figma integration

All Components are now PWA (or Capacitor) ready and can provide an almost native experience.
