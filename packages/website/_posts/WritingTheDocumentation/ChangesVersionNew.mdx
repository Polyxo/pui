We are now providing a set of guidelines for PWA development. The Components are now PWA (or Capacitor) ready and can provide an almost native experience. You can find them [here](/documentation/guidelines/pwa).

### Icons

### Mono-Repo

Restructured to have a more dynamic mono-repo structure.
For example now you can import only the packages you need. For example `un/react` for the react components and `un/styles` for the css styles.

### New and updated components

Components like `Accordion` and `Callout` have been added and components like `DatePicker` and `RadioButton` have been rewritten.

### Theming

You can now create custom themes and tokens. This enables the `Darkmode` and the use in projects that not follow the WFP Design System.

### Figma integration

Figma is now the source of Truth for all tokens.

### Accessibility

The overall accessibility has improved by providing the required `aria` attributes and `tabindex` for keyboard navigation.

### Hook based elements

The design system now provides react hooks for better customization and and creating reusable elements.

### CSS stays

CSS is still the source of truth for the design system. We are not using CSS in JS.

### Backwards compatibility

The new version is not 100% backwards compatible. We are working on a migration guide.

### Next: React Native support
