### Mono-Repo

Restructured to have a more dynamic mono-repo structure.
For example now you can import only the packages you need. For example `un/react` for the react components and `un/styles` for the css styles.

### Theming

You can now create custom themes and tokens. This enables the `Darkmode` and the use in projects that not follow the WFP Design System.

### Figma integration

Providing hooks for better implementation.

### CSS stays

We use css

### Next: React Native support
