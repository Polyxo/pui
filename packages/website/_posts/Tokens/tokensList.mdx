## 📦 Component

Here we are referencing your System Tokens to define the bits and pieces that make up your component, such as a button or an input field.

## ⚙️ System

These tokens reference the Global Tokens directly to form the visual interpretation of our design system. This set of tokens make opinionated choices around base sizing, typography scales, main border radiuses, status colors, etc.
