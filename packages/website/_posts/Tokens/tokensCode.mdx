You can import the tokens as a `JSON` file, `CSS` variables or `sass`.

### JSON

This file contains all tokens with a lot of additional information and can be used in any build system.

<Callout kind="warning">
  Make sure to not import the full file in your production build, as it is quite
  large.
</Callout>

TODO: Instead, you can import the `variables.json` file, which only contains the token values.

```jsx
import tokens from "@wfp/themes-core/dist/json/variables-full.json";
```

### CSS

The CSS file contains all tokens as CSS variables as a sass mixin.

```css
@use "@wfp/themes-core/dist/scss/default-css-theme" as defaulttheme;

// Use the WFP theme
:root {
  @include defaulttheme.theme-default();
}
```

### SASS

[sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is a CSS preprocessor that allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.
It helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

#### tokens.scss

`tokens.scss` contains all tokens as `sass` variables. This file is used to generate the CSS file.

```css
@use "@wfp/themes-core/dist/scss/tokens" as tokens;

/* Contains
$content-content4-earthy-brown-content4-80: var(--content-content4-earthy-brown-content4-80, "#fda987") !default;
*/
```

#### tokensMapDeep.scss

`tokensMapDeep.scss` contains all tokens as a nested scss object.

```css
@use "@wfp/themes-core/dist/scss/tokensMapDeep" as tokensMapDeep;
```

#### tokensMapFlat.scss

`tokensMapFlat.scss` contains all tokens as a flat scss object.

```css
@use "@wfp/themes-core/dist/scss/tokensMapFlat" as tokensMapFlat;
```
