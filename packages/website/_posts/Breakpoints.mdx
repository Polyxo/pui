| sm         | 4       | 0      | 320px  |
| md         | 8       | 16px   | 672px  |
| lg         | 16      | 16px   | 1056px |
| xlg        | 16      | 16px   | 1312px |
| max        | 16      | 24px   | 1584px |

### Breakpoint mixins

The breakpoints are used in the following way:

```scss
// Example

  // Your styles here
}
```

The following mixins are available for use:
