When you are migration from the original WFP UI-Kit to Bridge you will need to consider the following breaking changes:

### Strategies for Migration

#### 1. Full migration to Bridge üí®

This approach is recommended for new projects or projects that are in the early stages of development.

#### 2. Incremental migration to Bridge üêå

Recommended for existing projects that are already using the original WFP UI-Kit. It allows you to migrate to Bridge incrementally, one component at a time and
allows you to use the original WFP UI-Kit and Bridge together in the same project.

[Example in Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/ui-kit-bridge-new-and-old-wv96l9?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx)

### Breaking Changes üí•

#### Design changes

The overall design of components is currently in progress. Please be aware that the design is subject to change.

#### Packages renamed

- `import { Component } from "@wfp/ui"` becomes `import { Component } from "@wfp/react"` for React components
- `@import '@wfp/react/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';` becomes `@import '@wfp/styles';"` for styles

#### Icon component (also affects Pictograms)

`<Icon icon={iconName} />` becomes `<IconName />` imported from `import { IconName }¬†from @wfp/icons-react`

Make sure to look at the usage [Icons documentation](https://dev.designsystem.wfp.org/documentation/icons/core-icons).

#### Renamed variables

- Multiple variables have been renamed. We are now using a Token system. `$ui-01` becomes `$layer` to provide better readability. A full list can be found [here](/documentation/tokens/list).

#### React components `inputRef`

- `inputRef` is deprecated. Use `ref` instead.

```jsx
// Before
<Input inputRef={yourRef} />

// After
<Input ref={yourRef} />
```

### Missing components

Some components are not yet available in Bridge.

- `ContentSwitcher`

### Components with breaking changes

#### Button

Does no longer accept `kind` = `danger--primary`, `danger--secondary` or `tertiary`.

```jsx
// Before
<Button kind="danger--primary" />

// After
<Button kind="danger" />
```

```jsx
// Before
<Button kind="tertiary" />

// After
<Button kind="secondary" />
```

#### MainNavigation

Does no longer accept a function inside `<MainNavigation />` to handle the click event.
Instead, use the `useMainNavigation` hook instead.
This is to make the component more flexible and to allow for better customization.

```jsx
// Before
<MainNavigation>
  {({ onClick }) => (
    <a onClick={toggleMenu}>Toogle Menu</a>
  )}
</MainNavigation>

// After
<MainNavigation>
<YourComponent />
</MainNavigation>

// Inside YourComponent
function YourComponent() {
    const { toggleMenu } = useMainNavigation();
    return (
        <a onClick={toggleMenu}>Toogle Menu</a>
    )
}
```
