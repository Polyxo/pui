> WFP front-end technology standards

> The WFP UI Kit uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the underlying JS framework, in line with the [WFP official guidelines for software development](https://newgo.wfp.org/documents/software-solutions-technology-stack). Therefore, **all WFP applications should use it**, together with the UI Kit. The only **exceptions** are off-the-shelf solutions (e.g. Saas) and/or non-apps (e.g. the external corporate website, and/or basic landing pages used for fundraising, etc).

## Create a React app

To kickstart your new project with the Kit, we do recommend to **generate a boilerplate React app** with the official [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool or other bootstraping tools. An example using the UI-Kit and `create-react-app` can be found [here](https://github.com/wfp/ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app).

You can use the [Codesandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/wfp-ui-template-5bef8) template to try out the Kit without installing anything.

## 1. Add the Kit as a dependency ðŸ“¦

The next step is to **add the Kit to your project as a dependency**. You can choose to install it through a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`.

To install the Kit through `npm`, run:

```bash
npm install @wfp/react @wfp/styles --save
```

To install the Kit through `yarn`, run:

```bash
yarn add @wfp/react @wfp/styles
```

## 2. Load the Styles ðŸŒˆ

This is a required step in case you want to load the full UI Kit stylesheet. You can either load the complete stylesheet or the scss files.

### Import the CSS

To import the full CSS through React, first make sure to have a `css` loader installed, then use the following code:

```jsx
import "@wfp/styles/styles.css";
```

### Alternative: Import the SCSS

To import the full SCSS through React, first make sure to have a `sass` loader installed, then use the following code:

```bash
npm install @wfp/themes-core --save-dev
```

In your custom `.scss` file, import the theme and the components you need.

```jsx
// Import all stylesheets
import '@wfp/styles';

// Use a theme
@use "@wfp/themes-core/dist/scss/default-css-theme" as defaulttheme;

:root {
  @include defaulttheme.theme-default();
}
```

### 3. Global Settings

Wrap your Application in the [WFPCoreProvider](/documentation/developing/themes) to apply global settings.

```jsx
import { WFPCoreProvider } from "@wfp/react";

<WFPCoreProvider>Your application</WFPCoreProvider>;
```

## Advanced Setup

### Importing only the stylesheets you need

Instead of importing all stylesheets, you can also import only the stylesheets you need. This is useful to reduce the size of your application.

```jsx
// Or import only the stylesheets you need
@use "@wfp/styles/scss/themes";
@use "@wfp/styles/scss/theme";
@use "@wfp/styles/scss/reset";
@use "@wfp/styles/scss/components";
```

### Install the latest features ðŸŒ±

<Callout kind="warning">
  This is not recommended for production environments.
</Callout>

Install the packages with the `@alpha` tag to get access to the latest features.

```bash
npm install @wfp/react@alpha  @wfp/styles@alpha
```
