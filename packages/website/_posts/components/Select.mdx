The select component collects user-provided information from a list of options. Selects are usually used in forms where a user submits data and chooses one option from a list.

## Usage

Use a dropdown list when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title, if the list of items is too long, or when space is constrained.
Use a dropdown list when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible, putting equal emphasis on all options).

### When to use

- ✓ The dropdown list label should describe what can be found in the menu.
- ✓ Use shortened statements or single words as list options.
- ✓ If there isn't a default option, use "Select an option" as placeholder text.
- ✓ If "None" is an option, include it.
- ✓ Write the choices using parallel construction. For example, start with the
  same part of speech or verb tense.

### When not to use

- ✗ Avoid using Select for less then 3 entries. Try using a radio button instead.
