Wrapper can wrap it's content in a specific width depending on if the application has a full or fixed width.

If not used with as `fullWidth` it centers content horizontally and ensures that it doesn't stretch indefinitely on larger screens.

<DoUse>

- Page Layout: Always use the Wrapper component as the outermost container for page-level content to maintain consistent layout and spacing.
- Centering Content: Utilize the Wrapper when you need to center content horizontally within a viewport.
- Controlling Width: When designing for content that shouldn't stretch across extremely wide screens, leverage the Wrapper to set a maximum content width.
- Responsive Designs: Adopt the Wrapper in responsive designs to ensure that content adapts gracefully across a range of device sizes.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Nested Wrapping: Avoid nesting multiple Wrapper components within each other. This can lead to redundant spacing and layout inconsistencies.
- Fixed-width Content: For components or content areas with a fixed width that won't change across screen sizes, don't use the Wrapper. Instead, define that fixed width explicitly.
- Side-by-Side Layouts: If designing a multi-column or grid layout where columns sit side-by-side and each column should adapt to its content, avoid using the Wrapper as it may restrict the desired fluidity.
