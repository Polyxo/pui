<DoUse>

- Filtering and batch action: Used to filter data either on a page, in a menu, or within a component. Checkboxes are found in Data table for batch editing purposes.
- Terms and conditions: Turning the checkbox input on or off can indicate whether you agree to the terms.
- Lists with sub-selections: Used when there is a parent and child relationship. You can use a parent checkbox to make a bulk selection of all list items. Unchecking the parent deselects all of the list items. Alternatively, you can select children individually when the parent is not selected, which is where the indeterminate state comes in to play.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- If a user can select only one option from a list, radio buttons should be
  used instead of checkboxes. Checkboxes allow the user to select multiple items
  in a set whereas radio buttons allow the user to select only one option.
