The `RadioButton` component represents a mutually exclusive option within a set, allowing users to select a single choice from a predefined list.

<DoUse>

- **Mutually Exclusive Options:** Implement `RadioButton` when users need to choose a single option from a set where only one selection is allowed.
- **Limited Choices:** Use `RadioButton` for relatively small sets of options (e.g., fewer than 5) to maintain clarity and simplicity.
- **Single Selection:** When users are required to make a single, distinct choice from a group of options.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- **Large Sets of Options:** Avoid `RadioButton` for extensive lists; consider alternative components like checkboxes or dropdown menus for improved usability.
- **Multi-Selection:** If users need to choose more than one option simultaneously, opt for checkboxes instead.
- **Space Constraints:** In situations with limited screen real estate, consider more compact components like dropdowns or toggle switches.

</DoNotUse>

### Alternative Components

- **Checkboxes:** When multiple selections are allowed.
- **Dropdown Menus:** For conserving space when dealing with a large set of options.
- **Toggle Switches:** When a binary choice (on/off) is more appropriate than a list of options.

### Accessibility Guidelines

- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Ensure users can navigate and select `RadioButton` using keyboard controls.
- **Focus Styles:** Clearly indicate the focus state for users navigating through the options using the keyboard.
- **Aria Roles:** Implement ARIA roles to enhance the accessibility of `RadioButton` for screen readers.
- **Labeling:** Provide clear and descriptive labels for each `RadioButton` to aid users with visual impairments.
- **Color Contrast:** Maintain sufficient color contrast between the `RadioButton` and its surroundings to assist users with visual disabilities.
