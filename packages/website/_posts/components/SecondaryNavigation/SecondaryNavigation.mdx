<DoUse>

- **To Organize Navigation Elements**: Use `SecondaryNavigation` to organize and display secondary navigation elements in a clear, structured manner. It's ideal for sub-pages or sections within your application.
- **With Page Titles**: Always use it with `SecondaryNavigationTitle` to provide context about the current page or section.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Utilize the `pageWidth` prop to maintain consistent layout and alignment with the rest of your page content, especially in responsive designs.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- **As Primary Navigation**: Do not use `SecondaryNavigation` as the primary navigation bar of your application. It is not designed to replace the main navigation menu.
- **Overcrowding**: Avoid adding too many elements or overly complex structures. Keep it simple and user-friendly.
- **Inconsistent Widths**: Do not mix different `pageWidth` values within the same application level to maintain a consistent layout.
- **Non-Descriptive Titles**: Do not use vague or generic titles. Titles should always give clear indications of the content they represent.
- **Frequent Changes**: Avoid changing the title too frequently within the same navigation context, as it can lead to user confusion.
