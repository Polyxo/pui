## SecondaryNavigation Component

The `SecondaryNavigation` component is used to display a page title and optionally, tab navigation. It provides a flexible way to structure the navigation elements and additional content in your application's secondary navigation bar.

## Example Usage

```jsx live
<SecondaryNavigation pageWidth="lg">
  <SecondaryNavigationTitle>Page Title</SecondaryNavigationTitle>
  {/* Additional content here */}
</SecondaryNavigation>
```

This example shows a secondary navigation bar with a large page width and a title. You can add more elements as children to customize the navigation bar further.

## SecondaryNavigationTitle Component

The `SecondaryNavigationTitle` component is used within the `SecondaryNavigation` to display the title of the page or section.

### Example Usage

```jsx live
<SecondaryNavigationTitle className="custom-class">
  Page Title
</SecondaryNavigationTitle>
```

In this example, the `SecondaryNavigationTitle` component is used to render a page title with an additional custom class.
