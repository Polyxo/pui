```jsx live
<Empty
  title="No results"
  kind="large"
  icon={<NutritionClusterPositive style={{ width: "3em" }} />}
>
  There are no results for your search
</Empty>
```

### Usage

Import the `Empty` component:

```jsx
import Empty from "@wfp/react";
```

Basic usage:

```jsx
<Empty title="No Data Available" kind="large">
  We couldnâ€™t find any results based on your search criteria.
</Empty>
```

Advanced usage with an icon and a button:

```jsx
import { MyCustomIcon, MyButton } from "./MyComponents";

<Empty
  title="No Data Found"
  icon={<MyCustomIcon />}
  button={<MyButton onClick={() => doSomething()}>Retry</MyButton>}
>
  Please check your filters or try searching with different keywords.
</Empty>;
```

### Notes

- The component internally provides default `Icon` and `Text` components, but these can be replaced with custom components via the `components` prop. This allows for a greater degree of flexibility and customization.

- Always ensure that the text and iconography used are clear and provide meaningful hints to users about the next possible steps.
