The `Empty` component is a visual indicator for a lack of content or data. It can be useful in scenarios like empty tables, lists, or search results.

The component provides a flexible design that allows users to specify icons, texts, buttons, and even replaceable components.

The component should usually cover the whole area of the section and have a slightly darker background than the regular content. It can be also used for large notification messages.

### Types of empty states

- **First use** – Occurs with a new product or service when there is still nothing to show.
- **User cleared** – Occurs when users complete actions such as clearing their inbox or task list, and the result is an empty screen.
- **Errors** – These occur when something goes wrong, or when there are issues such as a mobile phone going offline due to network problems.
- **No results/No data** – Occurs when there is nothing to show. This can happen if someone performs a search and the query is empty or there isn’t data available to show (when filtering for a date-range that has no data for example).

<DoUse>

- Can be the case for a empty list table or search results
- Cover the whole area where normally content would be displayed
- Add personality by adding an illustration or icon (for example by using FontAwesome)
- Tell your user to do something: provide a call-to-action button
- Can be also used for large notification messages

</DoUse>
