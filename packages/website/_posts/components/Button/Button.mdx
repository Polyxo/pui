### Examples

- Buttons should always have a label, except when using a universally understood and accessible icon.
- Optional icons should not be used for decoration and should only be included when necessary and strongly associated with the label text.
- The label can be hidden to create an icon-only button, with a tooltip providing the label when necessary.

### Usage

- Use Medium size for default interface, while you can use the small version for mobile or inside other interface elements (such as **Callout**, **Tables**, â€¦)
- Use a button group to show additional actions.
- When the button label is not visible, a tooltip will appear when the user hovers over the button. The tooltip will show the label text and, if applicable, a keyboard shortcut.

### Primary

```jsx live noCode
<Button kind="primary">Primary</Button>
```

Primary buttons are used for the main action on a page.

### Secondary

```jsx live noCode
<Button kind="secondary">Secondary</Button>
```

Secondary buttons are used for secondary actions on each page. There can be multiple secondary buttons on a page.

Button has a range of styles that cater to different needs. They are designed to highlight where users need to take action in order to proceed through a process.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

### Accessibility

Press the Space or Enter key to execute the button action. The button will remain in focus, unless it opens or closes a container, in which case the focus will move to the target or back to the caller.
