### Usage

They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

<DoUse>

- Buttons are used primarily on action items. Some examples include `Add`, `Save`, `Delete`, and `Sign up`. Each page can have one or two primary or accent buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary buttons.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

</DoNotUse>

### Actions ðŸŽ¬

When an action required by the user has more than one option, always use a a negative action button (`secondary`) paired with a positive action button (`primary` or `accent`) in that order.

Negative action buttons will be on the left. Positive action buttons should be on the right.

TODO: Check When these two types buttons are paired in the correct order, they will automatically space themselves apart.
