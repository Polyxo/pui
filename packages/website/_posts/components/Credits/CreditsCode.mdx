### Usage

The `info` prop is used to pass the credit information. It's a string that can contain the photographer's name, the source of the image, or any other relevant details you wish to include.

```jsx live
<Credits info="Photo: WFP/Cheick Omar Bandaogo">
  <img
    alt="Default illustration"
    src="https://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/styles/media_embed/public/2024-02/Harvest%20millet%20burkina%20faso_CheickOmar-Bandaogo_219_0.jpg"
  />
</Credits>
```

### Styling

The `Credits` component can be styled using CSS to match the design of your application. You can target the component's class to apply custom styles for the typography, background, or layout.
