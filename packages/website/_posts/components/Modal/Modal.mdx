**Modals** communicate information via a secondary window and allow the user to maintain the context of a particular task.

Use the Modal Wrapper component to encapsulate your Modal within a button.

## Usage

<DoUse>

- Grab the user’s attention: Use when you want to interrupt a user’s current task to catch the user’s full attention to something more important.
- Need user input:Use when you want to get information from the user. Ex. sign up or login form.
- Use when you want to show additional information without losing the context of the parent page. Ex. showing larger images or videos.
- Use when you want to show information that is not directly related to the parent page or other options that are “independent” from other pages. Ex. notifications.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Long content: Avoid using modal dialogs when the content needs a scrollbar.
- Long forms: Do not use when a long form is displayed.
- Complex decision making: Avoid modal dialogs for complex decision making that requires additional sources of information unavailable in the modal.
