## Examples

Using the `ReadMore` component is a simple way to keep longer content from cluttering up your page, giving you more control over how much content is displayed to visitors.

<DoUse>

- **Content Exceeding Display Limit:** Use `ReadMore` when presenting content that is too long to display entirely on the initial view, preventing overwhelming users with excessive information.
- **Teaser Content:** Employ `ReadMore` to show a concise preview of content, allowing users to access more details if they're interested.
- **Flexible Content Areas:** When the amount of content can vary, `ReadMore` provides a flexible solution for accommodating different lengths.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- **Short and Static Content:** Avoid `ReadMore` for content that is already brief and doesn't require expansion.
- **Disruptive Reading Flow:** In scenarios where users should consume content continuously without interruptions, opt for presenting the entire content upfront.
- **Inconsistent Usage:** Ensure uniformity in the usage of `ReadMore`; avoid using it inconsistently across different sections or pages.

</DoNotUse>

### Alternative Components

- **Accordions:** For organizing and presenting content in collapsible sections with headers.
- **Tabs:** When content can be logically divided into distinct categories or sections.
- **Pagination:** For navigating through lengthy content in a sequential manner.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that `ReadMore` can be easily accessed and activated using keyboard controls.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Provide descriptive labels and ensure screen readers can interpret and communicate the purpose of the `ReadMore` component.
- **Focus States:** Clearly indicate the focus state of `ReadMore` and any associated interactive elements for users navigating through the interface.
- **Animation Considerations:** If using animations to expand or collapse content, provide alternatives or ensure that they are accessible and don't cause discomfort for users with motion sensitivity.
- **Text Contrast:** Maintain sufficient contrast between the text in the `ReadMore` link and its background to enhance readability, especially for users with visual impairments.

Use the **`aria-label`** attribute to add context for screen reader users.

This will announce to the screen reader exactly where the link will take them.

## Design Purpose

- **Space Efficiency**: Ideal for conserving space on web pages without sacrificing content.
- **User Engagement**: Encourages user interaction by allowing them to control how much content they view.
- **Content Management**: Useful for articles, product descriptions, long lists, and more, where the full content might overwhelm the viewer initially.

## User Experience

- **Expand/Collapse Interaction**: Users can click to reveal more content or hide it, giving them control over their viewing experience.
- **Visual Cues**: Caret icons indicate the expandable and collapsible nature of the content.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Content expansion and collapse are designed to be smooth and not jarring to the user.

## Usage Scenarios

- **Blogs and Articles**: For long-form content where readers might prefer an overview before diving into the full article.
- **Product Descriptions**: In e-commerce, where detailed descriptions can be initially hidden to not overwhelm the shopper.
- **FAQ Sections**: For FAQs, allowing users to quickly scan through questions and expand only those they are interested in.
