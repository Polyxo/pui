The `ReadMore` component is a versatile UI element designed to manage the display of long content sections in a user-friendly manner. It allows users to choose between viewing the entire content or a condensed version, enhancing the user experience, especially in content-heavy interfaces.

## Design Purpose

- **Space Efficiency**: Ideal for conserving space on web pages without sacrificing content.
- **User Engagement**: Encourages user interaction by allowing them to control how much content they view.
- **Content Management**: Useful for articles, product descriptions, long lists, and more, where the full content might overwhelm the viewer initially.

## User Experience

- **Expand/Collapse Interaction**: Users can click to reveal more content or hide it, giving them control over their viewing experience.
- **Visual Cues**: Caret icons indicate the expandable and collapsible nature of the content.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Content expansion and collapse are designed to be smooth and not jarring to the user.

## Usage Scenarios

- **Blogs and Articles**: For long-form content where readers might prefer an overview before diving into the full article.
- **Product Descriptions**: In e-commerce, where detailed descriptions can be initially hidden to not overwhelm the shopper.
- **FAQ Sections**: For FAQs, allowing users to quickly scan through questions and expand only those they are interested in.
