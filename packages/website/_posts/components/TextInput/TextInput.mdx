Text inputs enable users to enter free-form text data. The type of text field used should reflect the length of the content you expect the user to enter. The default text input is for short, one-line content, whereas text area is for longer, multi-line entries.

<DoUse>

- A user needs to input unique information that cannot be predicted with a preset of options.
- A user needs to input memorable data that can be entered more quickly in a free-hand format versus a more complex control.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>
  - If a user can only enter an option from a predefined list then avoid using a
  free-form text input as it is likely to result in an error. Consider using a
  selection control such as a dropdown, select, or radio button group instead.
