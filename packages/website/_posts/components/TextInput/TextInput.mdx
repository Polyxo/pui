Text inputs enable users to enter free-form text data. The type of text field used should reflect the length of the content you expect the user to enter. The default text input is for short, one-line content, whereas text area is for longer, multi-line entries.

<DoUse>

- **User Input:** Utilize the Text Input component when users need to enter textual or numeric data, such as names, addresses, or search queries.
- **Form Fields:** Incorporate the Text Input within forms for capturing user responses, enabling data submission or interaction with the system.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement the Text Input for search bars or filters, allowing users to input search terms or refine results dynamically.
- **Data Filtering:** Use Text Inputs in data-driven interfaces where users can filter or narrow down datasets based on specific criteria.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- **Non-Editable Content:** Avoid using Text Inputs for displaying non-editable text or content, as it may confuse users expecting interaction.
- **Limited Input Options:** If users are expected to select options from a predefined set or make binary choices, consider using radio buttons, checkboxes, or dropdown menus instead.
- **Data Display:** If the primary purpose is to display data rather than capture user input, explore alternatives such as text areas or read-only fields.
- **Complex Data Input:** For complex data input requiring specialized formats or interactions, consider using dedicated components or multi-step forms to guide users through the process efficiently.

</DoNotUse>

### Accessibility

- **Labeling:** Always associate Text Inputs with descriptive labels to provide context for screen reader users and users with cognitive disabilities.
- **Input Type:** Utilize appropriate input types (e.g., text, email, number) to enable device-specific keyboards and enhance accessibility for users with motor impairments.
- **Placeholder Text:** Use placeholder text sparingly and ensure it conveys additional information rather than replacing the label for users who rely on screen readers.
- **Error Handling:** Clearly communicate any input errors or validation messages adjacent to the Text Input, ensuring users are aware of any issues and how to resolve them.
- **Focus Management:** Implement clear focus indicators and ensure logical tab order within forms to assist users navigating with keyboards or assistive technologies.
- **Testing with Assistive Technologies:** Regularly test Text Input components with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies to identify and address accessibility barriers.
