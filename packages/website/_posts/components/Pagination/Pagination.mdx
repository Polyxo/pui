The `Pagination` component is designed to control the display of paginated data.

It allows users to navigate through pages of data, offering a range of features like customizing the number of items per page, navigating backward and forward through the dataset, and displaying the current range of data being viewed.

<DoUse>

- Use `Pagination` when managing large datasets that need to be broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks.
- Utilize the `itemsPerPageText` to indicate the number of items per page.
- Leverage the `pageRangeText` and `itemRangeText` for providing users with context on their current position within the data.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Avoid using `Pagination` for small datasets where pagination would add unnecessary complexity.
- Do not use `Pagination` in a situation where the order or number of items per page should not be controlled by the user.

</DoNotUse>

## Content

### Length

`Pagination` is ideal for datasets that are too large to be displayed in one view. It breaks down the data into manageable parts based on the specified `pageSize`.

### Order

The component allows users to navigate data in a logical sequence, either backward or forward, providing a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and their location within it.

### Text

The component uses descriptive texts for navigation and displaying the current data range, enhancing usability and accessibility.
