Multiple or single tags can be used to categorize items.

Use short labels for easy scanning. Use two words only if necessary to describe the status and differentiate it from other tags.

<DoUse>

- Use tags when content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them.
- Tags can also be used as a method of filtering data, to show only items within that particular category.
