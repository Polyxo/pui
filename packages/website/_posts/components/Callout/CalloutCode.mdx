The `Callout` component is a flexible and customizable notification component used to display a variety of messages to users, such as alerts, warnings, information, and success messages.

## Usage

```jsx live
<Callout
  title="Your Title"
  subtitle="Your subtitle"
  kind="info"
  // ...other props
>
  Your content here
</Callout>
```

## Example

```jsx live
<Callout
  title="Network Error"
  subtitle="There was an error connecting to the server"
  kind="error"
  onClose={() => console.log("Closed")}
>
  Please check your internet connection and try again.
</Callout>
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure the `role` prop is set appropriately to ensure screen readers interpret the notification correctly.
- Use the `iconDescription` and `statusIconDescription` props to provide meaningful descriptions for icons.

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate `kind` values to indicate the nature of the notification (e.g., error, success).
- Keep titles and subtitles concise and informative.
- Use actions sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user.
