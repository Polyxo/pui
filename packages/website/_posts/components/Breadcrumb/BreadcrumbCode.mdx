### Usage

```jsx live
<Breadcrumb>
  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <a href="/#">
      <BreadcrumbHome />
    </a>
  </BreadcrumbItem>
  <BreadcrumbItem href="#">Breadcrumb 2</BreadcrumbItem>
  <BreadcrumbItem disableLink>Breadcrumb 3</BreadcrumbItem>
</Breadcrumb>
```

The `BreadcrumbHome` component offers an intuitive way to represent the home location within a breadcrumb trail, using an icon. With its integration from `@wfp/icons-react`, it provides a visual representation for the start of a breadcrumb path.

### Usage

Import the `BreadcrumbHome` component:

```jsx
import BreadcrumbHome from "@wfp/react";
```

Here's a basic example of how to use the `BreadcrumbHome`:

```jsx
<BreadcrumbHome hometext="Back to Home" className="custom-home-class" />
```

In this example, the `BreadcrumbHome` displays a home icon. If hovered (or on focus), it should ideally display a tooltip or provide an accessibility description saying "Back to Home". The icon also gets an additional custom CSS class `custom-home-class` for further styling.

### Notes

- It's always a good practice to provide a meaningful `hometext` for better accessibility.

The `BreadcrumbItem` component is a versatile piece of a breadcrumb trail, offering flexibility in rendering items as text, links, or custom elements. It plays a crucial role in guiding users to navigate and understand their position in an application or website.

### Usage

Import the `BreadcrumbItem` component:

```jsx
import BreadcrumbItem from "@wfp/react";
```

Here's an example showcasing the different ways you can use the `BreadcrumbItem`:

```jsx
<BreadcrumbItem href="/home">Home</BreadcrumbItem>
<BreadcrumbItem disableLink={true}>Settings</BreadcrumbItem>
<BreadcrumbItem>
  <Link href="/profile">Profile</Link>
</BreadcrumbItem>
```

In this example:

1. The first `BreadcrumbItem` is a clickable link leading to `/home`.
2. The second one is non-clickable, displaying the text "Settings".
3. The third one uses a custom `Link` component as its child, leading to `/profile`.

### Notes

- The internal `newChild` function manages the rendering of the breadcrumb's child content based on the provided props. For instance, it will render a simple text if `disableLink` is true or use the `Link` component if an `href` is given with a string child.

- It's always a good practice to use descriptive breadcrumb items that give clear clues to users about their navigation trail.
