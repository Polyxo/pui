The example below shows an uncontrolled Toggle component. To use the Toggle component as a controlled component, set the toggled property.
Setting the toggled property will allow you to change the value dynamically, whereas setting the defaultToggled
prop will only set the value initially.

<DoUse>
  
- A user needs to input unique information that cannot be predicted with a preset of options.
- A user needs to input memorable data that can be entered more quickly in a free-hand format versus a more complex control.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>
  - If a user can only enter an option from a predefined list then avoid using a
  free-form text input as it is likely to result in an error. Consider using a
  selection control such as a dropdown, select, or radio button group instead.
</DoNotUse>
