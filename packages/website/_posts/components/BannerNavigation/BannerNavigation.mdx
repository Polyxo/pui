The default component is used mainly to crosslink among specific WFP applications for **internal use only**.

Thus, **the default component does not have to be used for external facing products**.

The internal applications are: [WFPgo](https://newgo.wfp.org), [Communities](https://communities.wfp.org), [Manuals](https://manuals.wfp.org), [GoDocs](https://go.docs.wfp.org), [WeLearn](https://welearn.wfp.org), [Dashboard](https://dashboard.wfp.org), [OPweb](https://opweb.wfp.org), [Self-Service](https://selfservice.go.wf.org), [UN Booking Hub](https://humanitarianbooking.wfp.org/), [WFP.org](https://wfp.org)

The **custom version** is used when the application has multiple pages to be visited by the user. This component allows these different pages to be easily accessible. Do not use `BannerNavigation` when you have only one page.

There are two variants of `BannerNavigation` that can be used:

### `BannerNavigationWithContent`

Used exclusively by specific applications which are actually listed on the bar to crosslink between them.

### `BannerNavigation`

It allows you to use custom `BannerNavigationItem` components inside.
