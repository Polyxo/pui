Multiple or single `Tags` can be used to categorize items. Use short labels for easy scanning. Use two words only if necessary to describe the status and differentiate it from other tags.

### Clearable Tags

Tag con be used both as an indicator of status and to show a selection. Use the clear icon when the selection can be dismissed.

<DoUse>

- Use tags when content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them.
- Utilize to visually represent metadata, labels, or categories associated with content.
- Use to facilitate filtering, sorting, or searching functionality within a user interface.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Donâ€™t use as a `button` or `link`
- Do not overload the Tag with too much content. It is designed for brief labels or categorizations.
- Avoid overusing for decorative purposes without meaningful context or function.
- Do not use as a substitute for more appropriate UI elements, such as buttons or checkboxes, in interactive contexts.

### Alternative components

Dropdown menus or filters can be used instead of TAGs in cases where a more compact or hierarchical presentation of options is needed.
