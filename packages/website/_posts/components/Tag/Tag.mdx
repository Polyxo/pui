Multiple or single `Tags` can be used to categorize items. Use short labels for easy scanning. Use two words only if necessary to describe the status and differentiate it from other tags.

<DoUse>

- Use tags when content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them.
- Tags can also be used as a method of filtering data, to show only items within that particular category.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Donâ€™t use as a `button` or `link`
- Do not overload the Tag with too much content. It is designed for brief labels or categorizations.
