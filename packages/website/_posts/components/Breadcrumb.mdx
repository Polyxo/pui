### Usage

```jsx live
<Breadcrumb>
  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <a href="/#">
      <BreadcrumbHome />
    </a>
  </BreadcrumbItem>
  <BreadcrumbItem href="#">Breadcrumb 2</BreadcrumbItem>
  <BreadcrumbItem disableLink>Breadcrumb 3</BreadcrumbItem>
</Breadcrumb>
```

Breadcrumbs show users their current location relative to the information architecture and enable them to quickly move up to a parent level or previous step.

<DoUse>

- Breadcrumbs are effective in products and experiences that have a large amount of content organized in a hierarchy of more than two levels. They take up little space but still provide context for the user’s place in the navigation hierarchy.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Breadcrumbs are always treated as secondary and should never entirely replace the primary navigation. They shouldn’t be used for products that have single level navigation because they create unnecessary clutter.

</DoNotUse>

### Formatting

1. **Page link(1):** Directs users to the parent-level page.

2. **Separator(2):** Clearly distinguishes between each page.

By default, breadcrumb trails should not include the current page. If a page doesn’t have a title or the current page is not clear, it can be included in the breadcrumb trail. If the current page is included in a breadcrumb trail, it is always the last text listed and is not an interactive link.
