Links can have the same properties as a regular `<a>`-element.

<DoUse>

- Use text for links rather than graphics or icons.
- Links should be three words or less.
- Text should be consistent with the title of the intended destination.
- Navigate to a different page within the application
- Navigate to an entirely different site
- Jump to an element on the same page
- Link to emails or phone numbers

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Avoid the term “click here“, “other links“ to “here,” or the web address itself. Instead, use a meaningful descriptive label for the link, and match the destination site name.
- Use a button instead of a link for actions that will change data or manipulate how it is displayed, change a state, or trigger an action. Buttons should never be used for navigational actions.
