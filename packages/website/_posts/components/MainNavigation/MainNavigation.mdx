### Internal applications

<FigmaImage url="https://www.figma.com/file/KWrOuAzzykyysIDFpLikx1/WFP---Bridge?node-id=608%3A22582" />

Internal applications are required to use the `MainNavigation` in combination with the `BannerNavigation`. The `BannerNavigation` is used to navigate between the different applications.

### External applications

<FigmaImage url="https://www.figma.com/file/KWrOuAzzykyysIDFpLikx1/WFP---Bridge?node-id=608%3A22582" />

External applications should use the big ribbon logo.

### Mobile view

On smartphones, the MainNavigation is collapsed and the user can open it by clicking on the hamburger icon.

TODO: There is also the possiblility to place icon buttons next to the hamburger icon for accessing the most important features of the application.

### SubNavigation

The `MainNavigation` can contain `MainNavigationItem`'s with a `SubNavigation` component. The `SubNavigation` component is used to display additional content.

The maximum number of items is 6 to 8 items depending on the average word length.

The `SubNavigation` component provides a toggleable part of the `MainNavigation`. It consists of various sub-components that allow for the creation of headers, items, links, titles, filters, content areas, lists, and groups.

```jsx
import {
  SubNavigation,
  SubNavigationHeader,
  SubNavigationTitle,
  SubNavigationLink,
  SubNavigationFilter,
  SubNavigationContent,
  SubNavigationList,
  SubNavigationGroup,
  SubNavigationItem,
} from "@wfp/react";

() => (
  <SubNavigation>
    <SubNavigationHeader>SubNav Header</SubNavigationHeader>
    <SubNavigationItem>
      <SubNavigationLink href="http://communities.wfp.org" target="_blank">
        SubNav Link
      </SubNavigationLink>
    </SubNavigationItem>
  </SubNavigation>
);
```

### Components:

- **SubNavigation**: This is the main wrapper for the sub-navigation.
- **SubNavigationHeader**: Use this component to set a header for your sub-navigation.
- **SubNavigationTitle**: This component sets a title for your sub-navigation.
- **SubNavigationLink**: This component creates links within the sub-navigation. They can be used similar to the traditional anchor links.
- **SubNavigationFilter**: This is used to integrate a filter mechanism within your sub-navigation.
- **SubNavigationContent**: This is a wrapper for the content that should be displayed within the sub-navigation.
- **SubNavigationList**: This component wraps a list of items or links within the sub-navigation.
- **SubNavigationGroup**: This allows you to group multiple items or links under a single heading. The group can have a title and is ideal for categorizing sub-navigation elements.
- **SubNavigationItem**: These are individual items within the sub-navigation.

Each of these components can accept a `className` prop to override or add additional classes. They also spread other properties to their root element, allowing you to pass other props like `id`, `style`, etc.
