### Usage

```jsx
<Avatar image="user-image-url.jpg" name="John Doe" alt="John Doe's Avatar" />
```

### Component Behavior

- **Default Icon:** If the `image` prop is not provided and `missingImage` is set to "avatar", a default user icon is displayed.
- **Initial Letter:** If the `image` prop is undefined and `missingImage` is "letter", an SVG with the user's initial letter is rendered.
- **Custom Image:** If the `image` prop is provided, it is displayed as the user's avatar.

### Styling

- The component utilizes a CSS class naming scheme based on a `prefix` obtained from the `useSettings` hook. This prefix is prepended to various CSS class names for consistent styling across the design system.

### Accessibility

- The `alt` prop should be used to provide descriptive alternative text for the avatar image, enhancing accessibility for screen reader users.

### Example

```jsx
<Avatar
  image="https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
  alt="User's name"
  missingImage="avatar"
  name="Jane Doe"
/>
```

In this example, the `Avatar` component displays the image from the provided URL. If the URL is not available, it falls back to the default user icon. The `alt` text for the image is "User's name", and the user's name "Jane Doe" is used for generating the initial in the fallback letter mode.
