```jsx live
<Slider
  min={0}
  max={100}
  step={1}
  value={50}
  onChange={(newValue) => console.log(newValue)}
/>
```

Sliders are used to select from a range of values. The `min` and `max` props define the range of values, while `step` determines the intervals between values.

```jsx live
<>
  <Slider min={0} max={100} value={30} disabled />
  <Slider min={0} max={100} value={70} hideTextInput />
</>
```

In these examples, the first slider is disabled, and the second one hides the text input. These options provide additional flexibility for different use cases.
