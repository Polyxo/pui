The User is used inside the `MainNavigation` and can display an avatar and username. It can be also used inside forms, etc. with the extended prop.

<DoUse>

- Use the `User` component to represent individual users, especially in contexts like navigation bars, user profiles, or forms.
- Utilize the `image` prop for adding user avatars, enhancing visual recognition.
- Apply the `name` prop to display the user's name, ensuring it is clearly visible next to the avatar.
- Use `ellipsis` prop for names that might be too long.
- Employ `description` and `extendedDescription` props for additional user information, providing context and details about the user.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>
  
- Do not use the `User` component for non-user-related entities. It is specifically designed for representing individual users.
