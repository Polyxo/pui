The `User` component extends the functionality of the [Avatar](../structure/avatar) component by incorporating user-related information such as name and descriptions. This component is commonly used in [main navigation](../../navigation/mainnavigation) and forms.

### Usage

```jsx live
<User
  image="https://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/styles/page_accordion/public/images/ourwork_humanitarian.jpg?itok=R0ymBwxH"
  name="John Doe"
  alt="John Doe's Avatar"
  showName
/>
```

### Component Behavior

- **Avatar Display:** Utilizes the `Avatar` component to display the user's image or a fallback icon.
- **Name and Descriptions:** Optionally displays the user's name, a brief description, and an extended description based on props.
- **Customizable Appearance:** Supports custom styling and component replacement through `className` and `components` props.

### Accessibility

- The `alt` prop is crucial for screen reader accessibility, providing a text alternative for the avatar image.

### Example

```jsx live
<User
  image="https://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/styles/page_accordion/public/images/ourwork_humanitarian.jpg?itok=R0ymBwxH"
  alt="Jane Doe's avatar"
  name="Jane Doe"
  ellipsis
  description={<p>Project Manager</p>}
  extendedDescription={<p>Additional details about Jane Doe</p>}
  showName
/>
```

In this example, the `User` component displays an avatar with the image from the provided URL. If the URL is unavailable, the component defaults to the specified missing image mode. The user's name, "Jane Doe," is displayed with an ellipsis for long names. Below the name, a brief description and an extended description provide additional information about the user.
