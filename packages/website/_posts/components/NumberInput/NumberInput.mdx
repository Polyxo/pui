`NumberInput` are used to let the user enter a number. They include built-in validation to reject non-numerical entries. They provide stepper arrows to let the user increase and decrease the value using their mouse or by simply tapping with a fingertip.

<DoUse>
    
- Enable the user to also choose to type a number in the field.
- Ensure that a default value is shown within the field.
- Use a clear and concise label for the number input.
- Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) for the label.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Do not use number inputs when large value changes are expected. They work best for making small, incremental changes that require only a few clicks.
