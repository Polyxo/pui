**TextArea** represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.

<DoUse>

- Make sure the default size of the TextArea covers the requested amount of text.
- A user needs to input unique information that cannot be predicted with a
  preset of options.
- A user needs to input memorable data that can be entered
  more quickly in a free-hand format versus a more complex control.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- A user needs to input a short amount of text. Use a
  [TextInput](/Components/Forms/TextInput) instead. - If a user can only enter an
  option from a predefined list then avoid using a free-form text input as it is
  likely to result in an error. Consider using a selection control such as a
  dropdown, select, or radio button group instead.
