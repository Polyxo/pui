**Search** enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find particular relevant pieces of content without the use of navigation. Search can be used as the primary means of discovering content, or as a filter to aid the user in finding content.

<DoUse>

- To help users find data more efficiently within a complex or large data set.
- Use at a global level when searching an entire site.
- Use at a page level when searching through content on one page specifically.
- Use at a component level when searching data in a component, like a data table.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Do not use when there is small or limited amounts of data.
- Do not use when the information is simple and can be found easily within one view.

</DoNotUse>

### Usage with react

```js live
() => {
  const handleOnChange = (searchValue, evt) => {
    console.log('searchValue', searchValue); // a string
    console.log('evt', evt); // the whole event object
  };

  return (
    <Search
      className="some-class"
      kind="large"
      name="input-name"
      labelText="Label"
      closeButtonLabelText="The label text for the close button"
      placeHolderText="Placeholder"
      onChange={handleOnChange}
    />
  );
};
```
