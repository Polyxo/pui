Cards are a convenient means of displaying content composed of different types of objects. It is a multi usage component which creates boxes that are usually teasing some kind of content.

## Accessibility

For accessibility purposes, it's important to provide meaningful `alt` text for images within the card. If the card functions as a link, consider setting `isExternal` appropriately to inform users when links open in a new window.
