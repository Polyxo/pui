## Usage

The `Card` component can be used in various ways depending on the provided props. For example, it can serve as a clickable link to external content, display an image with a title and subtitle, or simply showcase additional metadata. The component supports different styles or kinds, such as overlay images or simple cards, which can be specified using the `kind` prop.

### Example

Simple card with an image, title, subtitle, and metadata:

```jsx live
<Card
  image="https://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/styles/card_featured/public/images/HughRutherford-1872.jpg"
  isExternal={true}
  isLink={true}
  subTitle="This is a card subtitle."
  title="Card Title"
  metadata="Metadata example"
  alt="Alternative text for the image"
  kind="simple-card"
  url="https://wfp.org"
/>
```

Overlay card with an image, title, subtitle, and metadata:

## Styling

The component uses a combination of its own styles and those passed through `className`. It dynamically applies classes based on the card's type (`kind`), whether it's a link (`isLink`), and additional user-defined classes (`className`). The card's dimensions can be customized using `cardWidth` and `cardHeight` props.
