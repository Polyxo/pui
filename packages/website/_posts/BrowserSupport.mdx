<Callout kind="warning" title="Internet Explorer support">

Please notice that Internet Explorer is no longer supported. Those applications that do not work properly or do not work at all in IE will need to include a warning message inviting the user to switch to a more modern browser.
The warning can be found [here]('Design|Templates', "Browser Warning").
