Internal Applications often only have to work on Android devices,
therefor the design should be based the principles of the Googles
Material UI.

- Use [WFP's branding colours](?path=/docs/core-colours--page)
- Use [Open Sans](?path=/docs/core-typography--page) as font
- Use shadows only to highlight important elements
- Keep in mind that applications often run on low-end devices with lacking network coverage

Use the [Android Material Editor](https://material.io/tools/) as a starting point.

#### Supported devices

Check your target audience before starting the development. Usually WFP's applications only need to work on Android.
