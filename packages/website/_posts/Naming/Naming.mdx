The UI Kit uses the [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming).

### Namespacing

The Components are built to be included individually and not clobber global
styles - all class attributes are prefixed by the `wfp--` prefix.

### Linting

Use [ES-Lint](https://eslint.org) which is a linting utility for JavaScript and JSX while building your React
Application to analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic
errors and suspicious constructs.

If you want to use the ESLint configuration in a project you can install it
with the [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app). It also includes the `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` accessibility rules by default. When
using Create React App no action is needed since it already includes the configuration.

### Basic rules used when building the UI Kit

- ECMAScript 6 features
- no require statements
- spaces (2 space indentation)
- Semicolon is required at the end of a line
