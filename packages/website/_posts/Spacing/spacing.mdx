We use a systematic approach to how we decide what spacing to use in order to achieve a consistent visual experience across our products.
We achieve this by using a spacing system.

Bridge use the [8pt Grid System](https://medium.com/swlh/the-comprehensive-8pt-grid-guide-aa16ff402179).

### Spacing scale

Use the spacing scale when building individual components. It includes small increments needed to create appropriate spatial relationships for detail-level designs. This scale is applied and used within all Bridge components.
