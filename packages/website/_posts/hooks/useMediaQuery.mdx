If you use this hook in an SSR context, set the `initializeWithValue` option to false.

Before Safari 14, `MediaQueryList` is based on `EventTarget` and only supports `addListener/removeListener` for media queries. If you don't support these versions you may remove these checks. Read more about this on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaQueryList/addListener).

```jsx
import { useMediaQuery } from "@progressiveui/react";

export default function Component() {
  const matches = useMediaQuery("(min-width: 768px)");

  return (
    <div>
      {`The view port is ${matches ? "at least" : "less than"} 768 pixels wide`}
    </div>
  );
}
```
