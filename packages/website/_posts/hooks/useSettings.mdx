The `useSettings` custom hook is designed to provide an easy and efficient way to access global settings.

## Overview

`useSettings` allows components to consume application settings defined in the `WFPCoreContext` without directly interacting with the context itself. It ensures that any component within the application can easily access and react to changes in global settings.

## Importing

```jsx
import { useSettings } from "@progressiveui/react";
```

## Usage

Make sure your component is wrapped by `<WFPCoreProvider>` to provide the settings to the context.

Here's a simple example of how to use the `useSettings` hook within a component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useSettings } from "@progressiveui/react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const settings = useSettings();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current theme: {settings.theme}</p>
      {/* Other component logic */}
    </div>
  );
};

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <WFPCoreProvider theme="dark">
      <MyComponent />
    </WFPCoreProvider>
  );
};
```

## Return Value

- **Type**: `AppContextInterface`
- **Description**: An object containing the current application settings, including:
  - `prefix`: A string prefix used for CSS class naming.
  - `selectorTabbable`: A string selector for tabbable elements.
  - `selectorFocusable`: A string selector for focusable elements.
  - `theme`: The current theme name (e.g., `"light"`, `"dark"`).
  - `actualTheme`: The actual theme being used, which could differ from `theme` if the theme is set to `"auto"` and depends on the system preference.
  - `initialized`: A boolean indicating whether the `WFPCoreContext` has been properly initialized.
  - `setTheme`: A function to change the current theme.
  - `wrapperElement`: An optional HTML element that serves as the wrapper for applying theme classes.

## Context and Provider

`useSettings` is part of a system alongside `WFPCoreContext` and `WFPCoreProvider`:

- **`WFPCoreContext`**: A React context created with `createContext`, initialized with default settings.
- **`WFPCoreProvider`**: A component that wraps the application or parts of it, providing the `WFPCoreContext` to all its children. It allows initializing the context with custom settings, including an initial theme, a CSS prefix, and a wrapper element for applying the theme.
