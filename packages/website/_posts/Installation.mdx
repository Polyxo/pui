> The WFP UI Kit uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the underlying JS framework, in line with the [WFP official guidelines for software development](https://newgo.wfp.org/documents/software-solutions-technology-stack). Therefore, **all WFP applications should use it**, together with the UI Kit. The only **exceptions** are off-the-shelf solutions (e.g. Saas) and/or non-apps (e.g. the external corporate website, and/or basic landing pages used for fundraising, etc).
